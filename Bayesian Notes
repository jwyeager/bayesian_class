Bayesian Notes

# Distribution function: p(x) = Prob(X=x)

# Continuous: a probability distribution over a continuous range
Cumulative distribution function: F(x) = Prob(X<=x)
Expressed as probability densities rather than probabilities

Binomial distribution: study with two possible outcomes
	- success or failure
3 seeds, 4 outcomes
0 germ, 1 germ, 2 germ, 3 germ
but could be 3 different success scenarios depending on what seed germinates

Bernoulli
Mean expected value = probability of success
E(x^2) - p^2
